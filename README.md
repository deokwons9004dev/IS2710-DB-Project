##### Any in-progress planning should be written under the WORKPAD.md
* This is like a scratch pad of implementation details and where most of the structuring and discussion will take place. 
* I highly suggest we use to the WORKPAD.md to do most of our implementation discussion and work with that during development. 
* Only when we feel confident about the state of our project should we use the contents of the WORKPAD.md to fill in the README, which is what the prof will most likely read.
